===============================================================================

Cruise Tools is a python plugin for QGIS (>3.10) that is supposed to fill a
niche for cruise planning purposes. There are a handful of steps that we go
through each time we extract coordinates for the bridge (DDM, not DD) or load a
bathymetry grid (set color scale, hillshade, etc.) or similar. This is annoying
and time consuming, hence, there needs to be a quicker way. This is what Cruise
Tools was created for. It's supposed to create one (or two or three) click
solutions to substitute 10 (or twenty or thirty) clicks.
The toolbox is a work in progress, however, it’s functional and should be used
along the way of development. Here is how:


===============================================================================
==============================   INSTALLATION   ===============================
===============================================================================

Cruise Tools is now available via the QGIS plugin repository.

If you prefer a manual installation, copy the cruisetools folder to your QGIS
plugin directory. You can find this here:

Windows:
    C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins
Mac:
    ~/Library/Application\ Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins
Linux:
    ~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins

Open QGIS and go to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins and activate Cruise
Tools (tick it). If the Cruise Tools toolbar is not visible, right click on an
open area on the toolbar and check Cruise Tools there as well.

Sad side note: So far, Cruise Tools is developed on and for Windows only. It
might work to some extend on a UNIX OS, but we never tested it. :/


===============================================================================
==================================   USE IT  ==================================
===============================================================================

At the moment (v1.1), the Cruise Tools toolbar comes with six different
buttons/categories:


==================================   README  ==================================

As you might have figures out, the logo button shows the README for quick
access to some rudimentary help. In the future, this may be extended with some
more comprehensive and visually appealing help. Who knows?!


================================   BATHYMETRY  ================================

Load Bathymetry:

You want to load a bathymetry (or topography) grid with hillshade and a nice
color scale. Doing this manually takes about 1000 clicks (depending on how
crazy your render settings are). Cruise Tools simply lets you select a grid
file (GeoTIFF or netCDF), sets some color settings and overlays it with a
hillshade that’s not just half transparently chucked on there like Ar*GIS users
tend to do, and adds everything to a handy sub group.
You can adjust the color bar and min/max values in the settings (see below).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Export Shaded Bathymetry:

While it's nice to view your (floating point) bathymetry in color and with an
ad-hoc hillshade in QGIS, once in a while you need to have a colored and shaded
RGB version of the grid for external applications of different sorts. To create
this, the necessary procedure was usually very time consuming and awkward, so
we built in a set of raster calculations that do the job for you. All you need
to do is select a grid which has all colors set to your liking, and select the
shading method.

Cruise Tools offers three multiplication based shading modes:
- Hillshade is shaded with a synthetic light source, 315° Azimuth, 45° Altitude
- Slope is shaded with the stretched slope inclination
- Combo shaded is a combination of the two, bringing together the best aspects
  of both methods. Also widely known as "Simon's magical relief visualization"

Note: The created raster will be loaded into the canvas. Please don't freak out
if you have holes in the grid. The reason might be your selection of color bar
and the fact that QGIS reads any RGB value that contains a 0 on any band as
nodata. However, your file itself is fine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate Raster Coverage:

This little UI tool lets you calculate the coverage of a loaded raster band.
It will first calculate the entire covered area of the square grid. If an NaN
value is set, it will additionally give you the actual data coverage in the
grid (calculated by percentage of non-NaN values).
Coverages are calculated based on the WGS84 ellipsoid.


=================================   CONTOURS  =================================

Create Contours:

You just used the Load Bathymetry function to show your beautiful seafloor
topography. But now you want contour lines to make it a bit more readable.
Creating contours in QGIS is usually a quicky, however, that’s where the work
begins. You might want to have smoothed contours, you might want to filter the
little short bits out, and you might want to add some contour labels that are
pointing in the cartographically correct direction (up hill). Simply select the
bathymetry raster layer and click the button, select your interval and Cruise
Tools will create the smoothed contours and apply the style you might have been
looking for.


==================================   VECTOR  ==================================

Write Geographic Coordinates:

You just created your point feature layer with all your selected stations but
now you need the coordinates, not in decimal degrees (DD) but also in degrees
decimal minutes (DDM). Select the point feature layer and click the button and
Cruise Tools will fill the layer’s attribute table with all the coordinates you
need. *

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write Line Length:

You just planned your survey lines with a line feature layer and now you need
to figure out how long those are in nautical miles to get a time estimate for
the survey. Yet, using a measurement tool for that is tedious. Select the line
feature layer and click the button and Cruise Tools will fill the layer’s
attribute table with all the distance measurements you need. *
If a "maxSpeed_kn" field exists and is filled, the steaming time in hours will
be written to the "time_h" field, if that exists as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write Polygon Area:

You just selected an area of interest (or multiple) for your cruise and now you
need an idea of the area size(s). Select the polygon feature layer and click
the button and Cruise Tools will do those measurements and fill the attribute
table of your layer. *

* All measurements are ellipsoidal based on the project's CRS ellipsoid.
  Latitude/Longitude coordinates refer to WGS84 (EPSG:4326).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swap Vectors:

This is a helper tool for contour lines since bathymetry/topography grids
sometimes come positive up and sometimes positive down. Depending on this the
contour line vectors might have the wrong direction and need to be swapped in
order to set the labels right. Select the contour layer and click the button
and Cruise Tools will flip those vector directions around like it’s nothing.


=================================   PLANNING  =================================

General Info:

The entire PLANNING menu is intended to create a base for easy export from QGIS
into various (vessel specific) exchange formats for the bridge's ECDIS. It has
a big fat 'under construction' sign on it, but is, for a limited number of
vessels, already usable. The idea is that the user creates a point or line
planning file from within Cruise Tools, which will a) have a number of fields
set up that are useful for the output formats and b) have a style applied that
might be handy. Then the layer can be filled with features and the table filled
with attributes. When exporting to bridge, Cruise Tools will check your
settings for the selected vessel and hence select the appropriate output
format. So far only RV Sonne and RV Maria S. Merian have output formats that
are specific to a certain ECDIS import mechanism. In both cases that is the SAM
Route to bridge tool and the exported csv needs to be copied into one of the
empty SAM Route *.XLSX sheets. For RV Polarstern this is for now same as the
default csv which simply contains all attributes and the geometry of the
features.
Additionally, since v1.1, there is a MBES coverage planning tool. See below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Point Planning File:

Create a point layer for station planning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Line Planning File:

Create a line layer for track/route/survey planning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planning Lines to Vertices:

Convert a line layer to a point feature layer with vertices. If a selection in
the line layer exists, only selected features will be converted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate MBES Coverage:

Planned your survey over a coarse resolution bathymetry grid like GEBCO and
need to check if the coverage of your lawn mower pattern create sufficient
overlap? This tool lets you combine line planning and bathymetry base in order
to get an approximated MBES coverage at specific swath angle settings (depth
dependet buffer) to visualize your potential survey coverage results.
Your segments (from vertex to vertex) will be projected in Mercator cartesian
lines and the buffer distance is calculated in an apropriate UTM projection.
All independent of your layer and project CRS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Export to Bridge:

Export a planning layer to your vessel specific exchange format. The export
tool works with both point and line layers. Line layers will be converted to
vertices temporarily. If a selection in the planning layer exists, only
selected features will be exported.


=================================   SETTINGS  =================================

The Settings dialog holds a small number of configuration parameters that will
be used by the different tools. Mainly it's intended to make some things like
color bar and min/max values for rasters more permanent to ease frequent
imports and exports during one specific campaign. The settings will surely be
extended in the future, but let's take baby steps.
