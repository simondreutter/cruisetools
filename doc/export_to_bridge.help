Export planning layer to a specific exchange format to get your coordinates up in the ship's ECDIS. Lines will be converted to route vertices and coordinates will be extracted and attached to the attributes.
So far only a default CSV export (all fields, all values) as well as a SAM Route Exchange style CSV format are supported, but more will come.
The SAM Route Exchange format for example is compatible with research vessels RV Maria S. Merian and RV Sonne.
