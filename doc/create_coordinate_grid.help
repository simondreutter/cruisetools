Create a vector line layer with geographic coordinate grids lines (EPSG:4326).
The grid can be created with different intervals in both Longitude and Latidude. If you consider creating a grid with less than 1 degree spacing, you can type fractions (like "1/2" or "1/30") in the fields.
Regarding the non-metric coversion from degree to minutes, the following intervals can make sense:
[1/60, 1/30, 1/20, 1/15, 1/10, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/2, 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 20, 30]
The "Pole Gap" parameter specifies, how far the grid will be created towards the North and South Pole. A coordinate grid up to -90°/90° can look strange in some projections. The minimum and maximum Latitude lines (90° - "pole gap") will always be generated.
The "Density Factor" specifies the number of vertices within one interval. For projections with curved grid lines, this avoids angular artifacts and ensures smooth curved lines.
A convenient style will be loaded with labels and a scale dependent filter. The -180° (180°W) grid line will not be labeled to avoid double labels in polar stereographic projections.
