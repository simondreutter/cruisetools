Create parallel lines for an input line planning layer.
Parallel line features will be added inplace to the original layer. Changes will not be commited, so the layer will be in edit mode and changes can be discarded.
Set the offset in meters. Your line features will be transformed to UTM for the offset calculation to minimize distortion, and then back to the original layer CRS.
Parallel lines can be created starboard (right) or port (left) side of the initial line.
Set the number of parallel lines to be created.
