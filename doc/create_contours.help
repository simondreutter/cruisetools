Create smooth (depth) contours with a decent symbology and labels.
If the output is a GPKG (recommended), the style will be written to the file as Default.
Contour features will have length (m) attribute for filtering short lines.
Sometimes, for unknown reasons, the CRS is not properly set on the GDAL Contour output. In this case simply retry and hope for the best.
