Estimate Multibeam Echosounder coverage as polygon of swath width depending on coarse depth information.
Select a survey line layer or selected features in a line layer.
Coverage polygons can be dissolved per feature for a better visual representation. This may or may not make sense, depending on how you structured your line features.
If a field with the (total) swath angle is present in the input layer attributes, select that, if not set a swath angle fallback value.
Select a bathymetry raster layer (e.g., GEBCO) and band and retrieve an estimate of your MBES coverage.
The resulting polygon will be computed for each LineString segment and optionally dissolved for each feature (default).
The prediction assumes a reasonably flat seafloor. In regions with high topographic variations, results might vary strongly from actual achievable MBES coverage.
[Advanced Parameters] Alternatively, choose separate swath openening anlges for port and starbord.
