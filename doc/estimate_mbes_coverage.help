Estimate Multibeam Echosounder coverage as polygon of swath width depending on coarse depth information.
Select a survey line layer. If a field with the (total) swath angle is present, select that, if not set a swath angle fallback value.
Select a bathymetry raster layer (e.g., GEBCO) and band and retrieve an estimate of your MBES coverage.
The resulting polygon will be computed for each LineString segment and optionally dissolved for each feature (default).
The prediction assumes a reasonably flat seafloor. In regions with high topographic variations, results might vary strongly from actual achievable MBES coverage.
[Advanced Parameters] Alternatively, choose separate swath openening anlges for port and starbord.
