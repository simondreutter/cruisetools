Estimate Multibeam Echosounder coverage as polygon of swath width depending on coarse depth information.
Select a survey line layer. If a field with the (total) swath angle is present, select that, if not set a swath angle fallback value.
Select a bathymetry raster layer (e.g. GEBCO) and band and retrieve an estimate of your MBES coverage results.
The prediction assumes a flat seafloor. In regions with high topographic variations, results might vary strongly from actual achievable MBES coverage.
