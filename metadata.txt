about=
  On marine research cruises, one has to perform reoccuring tasks over an over again which might require a whole bunch of clicks each time. Cruise Tools intends to offer one click (or two click) solutions for some of these tasks.
  
  This includes:
    - loading, coloring and shading bathymetry grids
    - exporting colored and shaded RGB grids
    - calculating raster coverage
    - creating smooth filtered contours
    - generating DD and DDM coordinate attributes for point features
    - generating length (m and nm) attributes for line features
    - generating area (m2 and km2) attributes for polygon features
    - as well as some cruise planning mechanisms
  
  Cruise Tools is developed for Windows 10, but we intend to check OS compatibility in the future.
